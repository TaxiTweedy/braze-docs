# Braze navigation

> Summary of what's up with this page

## New navigation (beta)

> Summary of the nav beta, opt-in period timing, how to opt in, anything else they need to know

As part of the changes to our information architecture and navigation, we have also renamed "App Group" to "Workspace". If you're using our updated navigation, this change will be reflected throughout the dashboard.
